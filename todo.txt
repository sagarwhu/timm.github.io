==========
When applied as our
sampling method for crowdsourcing,
the Menzies methods would (a) recursively bi-cluster the data
using a first approximation to the  first PCA component (recomputed
for the data found at each level of the recursion); then (b) only ask the crowd
for a (small) number of sample of each leaf cluster.


Our preliminary work qualified workers by training and then testing them on specification concepts, but challenges remain in 
 how to do this efficiently and effectively (Section~\ref{})
% \kt{We've just said that MTurk is open call, but that MTurk was used for qualified experiments that are better than open call.... I think it's inaccurate, then, to call all MTurk experiments open call}
In addition to accessing qualified crowds through crowdsourcing platforms,
 via our IBM  industrial partners, we can access
large SE crowds with specialized  SE knowledge (see attached statement of
  interest in working with us on this project, from IBM's Research Triangle development team
  at Raleigh, North Carolina).  IBM runs its BlueMix product
as an ``internal open project''. At one recent hackathon open to only
IBM developers, 1,300 programmers colloberated to contribute nearly a 100 small
tools to BlueMix.  That is, with some evangelising within the BlueMix community,
we have ready access to the participants needed for this research.
