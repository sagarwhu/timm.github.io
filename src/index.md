I'm a top-100 most cited researcher
[out of 80,000+ authors](http://goo.gl/BnFJs)
(in SE, last 10 years).

So [back off man, I'm a scientist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEbSABWJiJc).



**Also:**

+ **Dec 20**: Invited to give keynote at the ICSE'15 workshop
[Architecture and Metrics](http://www.sei.cmu.edu/community/sam2015/speakers/?location=secondary-nav&source=971390).
+ **Dec 15**: ICSE has accepted my technical briefing for
  2015: Art and Science of Analyzing Software
  Data. With Leandro Minku and Fayola Peters.
+ **Dec 15**: ICSE accepts a paper with Fayola Peters on **LACE2**, a novel privacy-based transfer learner with some very nice properties
  (minimal data shared, all data privatized, better defect predictors learned by sharing data than just using your own).
+ **Nov 15**: IEEE Trans on Human Factors accepts  a paper with Joe Krall on **GALE**, a novel _O(log(N))_ MOEA/D optimizer that uses active learning and a non-parametric response surface method to quickly learn the best direction for mutating examples.
  GALE can find in minutes what other algorithms take hours to find.
+ **Oct 30**: Grant proposal submitted with Dr. Murphy Hill on a new generation journal/ repository.

### More About Me ###

In my time, I've been a
nurse/ taxi-driver/ rocket scientist/ newspaper
editor/ lecturer....  (what can I say? It all made
sense at the time).

I got to NcState after a
Ph.D. at UNSW, Sydney, 1995, then some time working with NASA (early last decade).
Then there was some free lance research for two years at Portland followed by a stint at West Virginia University (go 'eers).

I'm married to [Helen Burgess](http://helenburgess.com) who claims she's not Batman but I've never seen her and Bruce Wayne in the same room at the same time so....

```
Tim Menzies (Ph.D., UNSW, 1995) is a full Professor in CS at
North Carolina State University where he teaches software
engineering and automated software engineering. His research
relates to synergies between human and artificial intelligence,
with particular application to data mining for software
engineering.

He is the author of over 230 referred publications; and is one of
the 100 most cited authors in software engineering out of over
80,000 researchers (http://goo.gl/BnFJs).  In his career, he has
been a lead researcher on projects for NSF, NIJ, DoD, NASA, USDA,
as well as joint research work with private companies.

Prof. Menzies is the co-founder of the PROMISE conference series
devoted to reproducible experiments in software engineering
(http://opeenscience.us/repo).  He is an associate editor of IEEE
Transactions on Software Engineering, Empirical Software
Engineering and the Automated Software Engineering Journal. In
2015, he will serve as co-chair for the ICSE'15 NIER track.
