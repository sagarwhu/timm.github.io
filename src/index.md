<span class="firstcharacter">I</span> am a full (?fool) Professor in CS working
on SE, data mining, AI optimization, and
search-based SE, and better methods for open access
science. My Ph.D. was from UNSW (Australia) in 1995.

I teach [software engineering](http://www4.ncsu.edu/~tjmenzie/cs510)
 (in the spring) and [automated software engineering](https://github.com/timm/sbse14/wiki) (in the fall).

I run the [RAISE lab](http://ai4se.net) (real world
AI for software engineering) and the
[PROMISE repository](http://openscience.us/repo)
(storage for SE project data).

Right now, I am on a bunch of conference program committees:
[Icse'16](http://2016.icse.cs.txstate.edu/team/organizing-committee),
[Ase'15](http://ase2015.unl.edu/#tab-committee),
[Fse'15](http://esec-fse15.dei.polimi.it/committee.html),
[Icpc'15](https://dibt.unimol.it/ICPC15/Home.html),
[Msr'15](http://2015.msrconf.org/),
[Ease'15](http://emse.nju.edu.cn/ease2015),
[NasBase'15](http://nasbase.org/),
[Raise'15](http://promisedata.org/raise/2015/index.html),
[BigDSE'15](http://sse.uni-due.de/bigdse15). Also,
I'm an associate editor of
IEEE Trans on SE and Automated SE and 
and Empirical SE;
co-general-chair of
ICSME'16; co-pc-chair of ICSE NIER'15;
and serve on ASE conference  steering committee.

Over my career, I've won over $7M 
in grants and supervised 7+23  Ph.D.+masters students.
I've written  230+ referred papers
and am
a top-100 most cited researcher
[out of 80,000+ authors](http://goo.gl/BnFJs)
(in SE, last 10 years). So [back off man, I'm a scientist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEbSABWJiJc).


### News ###

+ **Dec 20**: Invited to give keynote at the ICSE'15 workshop
[Architecture and Metrics](http://www.sei.cmu.edu/community/sam2015/speakers/?location=secondary-nav&source=971390).
+ **Dec 15**: ICSE has accepted my technical briefing for
  2015: Art and Science of Analyzing Software
  Data. With Leandro Minku and Fayola Peters.
+ **Dec 15**: ICSE accepts a paper with Fayola Peters on **LACE2**, a novel privacy-based transfer learner with some very nice properties
  (minimal data shared, all data privatized, better defect predictors learned by sharing data than just using your own).
+ **Nov 15**: IEEE Trans on Human Factors accepts  a paper with Joe Krall on **GALE**, a novel _O(log(N))_ MOEA/D optimizer that uses active learning and a non-parametric response surface method to quickly learn the best direction for mutating examples.
  GALE can find in minutes what other algorithms take hours to find.
+ **Oct 30**: Grant proposal submitted with Dr. Murphy Hill on a new generation journal/ repository.


### Recent Talks ###

+ **ICSE'14** tutorial: [Art and Science of Analyzing Software Data](http://www.slideshare.net/timmenzies/the-art-and-science-of-analyzing-software-data)
+ **ICSE'14** workshop keynote (WetSOM'14): [What Metrics matter](http://www.slideshare.net/timmenzies/metrics-matter?related=1).

### More About Me ###

In my time, I've been a
nurse/ taxi-driver/ rocket scientist/ newspaper
editor/ lecturer....  (what can I say? It all made
sense at the time).

I got to NcState after a
Ph.D. at UNSW, Sydney, 1995, then some time working with NASA (early last decade).
Then there was some free lance research for two years at Portland followed by a stint at West Virginia University (go 'eers).

I'm married to [Helen Burgess](http://helenburgess.com) who claims she's not Batman but I've never seen her and Bruce Wayne in the same room at the same time so....<br clear=all>

```
Tim Menzies (Ph.D., UNSW, 1995) is a full Professor
in CS at North Carolina State University where he
teaches software engineering and automated software
engineering His research relates to synergies
between human and artificial intelligence, with
particular application to data mining for software
engineering.

He is the author of over 230 referred publications;
and is one of the 100 most cited authors in software
engineering out of over 80,000 researchers
(http://goo.gl/BnFJs).  In his career, he has been a
lead researcher on projects for NSF, NIJ, DoD, NASA,
USDA, as well as joint research work with private
companies.

Prof. Menzies is the co-founder of the PROMISE
conference series devoted to reproducible
experiments in software engineering
(http://opeenscience.us/repo).  He is an associate
